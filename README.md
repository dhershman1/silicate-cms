# Silicate Headless CMS

A simple locally hosted headless CMS. I planned to use this for myself on any future projects that required something like this, however the license is MIT and the plan it to keep it that way, so as it comes along feel free to use it for yourself!

## Features (Current and Planned)

- Complete Accessibility following WCAG Standards
- Handles all levels of content: Text, Images, Files, Themes, etc...
- Easy to use REST API to retrieve data objects for your content
- Authentication system baked right in
- Internal permissions system baked right in
- User management for the CMS itself
- Plug and play

## Technology

Built on [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) using the [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/) Framework.
